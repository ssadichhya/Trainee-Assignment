'''
Build a logging system using the Factory Design Pattern.
Create a LoggerFactory class that generates different types of loggers (e.g., FileLogger,
ConsoleLogger, DatabaseLogger). Implement methods in each logger to write logs to
their respective destinations. Show how the Factory Design Pattern helps to decouple
the logging system from the application and allows for flexible log handling.

# create an object from the different places where we use them
# factory class does the creation for the object rather than in the main function
